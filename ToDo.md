# Google Classroom Replica

The main goal of this project is to replicate google classroom as much as possible. The frontend will in react and the backend will be in spring boot.

### Activity Overview

- In classroom, users can do tasks based on their role. There will be a functionality for uploading and viewing assignments.

- In order to do that, an individual classroom should be created first. In that, two types of users will remain : student, teacher.

- After creating a room, users can give any post along with any files as attachments. In that post, anyone can comment.

- For assignment, a separate assignment post should be created by teachers. It can be seen both in posts section and assignment section. Within that assignment post, students can upload assignment. Additionally, teachers can attach a pdf/doc file into the assignment and put some description.

- Students should upload assignments in pdf/docx format. One student can not see other student's assignment.

- There should be a deadline for assignment. If any assignments are uploaded after the deadline, it should be flagged as late submit. Also teacher can turn off assignment submission after deadline.
